# cAPI

## Motivation

*Concepts as APIs with Programmable Interfaces*

You may ask: isn't it superfluous to add "Programmable Interfaces" to the name? You may further suspect that the author, yours truly, decided first to name this tool "cAPI" and only came up with the phrase denoted by that acronym after-the-fact.

I will not offer clarity as to the latter possible suspicion, but I will answer the former question - posed by myself to myself on your behalf: no.

The reason is: this is a simple tool for recording and communicating concepts (or sets of related concepts).

The idea is to represent a concept as a little application. The source code of your cAPI *is a representation of a concept*  (thus, the commit history of a particular cAPI functions as the history of the evolution of your understanding of some concept). However, sometimes you may want to see the concept differently, or communicate the concept to some other party who prefers consuming information in a medium other than source code.

So, the source code is the *canonical representation of the concept* which can be represented and consumed through a concept's API! Since I don't know how many possible concepts exist in all possible human minds, I have decided that the API itself ought to be programmable so that you, as the concept author, can determine at conceptualization-time the appropriate interface(s) through which your concept is available for consumption.
